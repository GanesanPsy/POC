			<b>Abstract</b>
			Common perception of students towards Technical education is highly paid jobs; relatively very few of them are inclined due to interest, passion, and self motivation. With wide and varied range of interest groups in technical student community, Current Technical education model is preparing technocrats to serve better in the industry. But in practice- it is not so, very recently IT companies have increased duration of training sessions of these selected candidates before actually assigning them on real projects. This surely focuses on the gap of technocrats passing out every year and the level of skilled candidates required by Industries. This paper proposes Development & Innovation Model to improve the employability in Industries. This model will incorporate dynamic nature of IT and other technological development in allied areas without adding too much cost to existing set-up and holding cost. The DC-model discussed in this paper incorporates recent learning system evolved like MOOCs and Online platform together with state of art approaches of learning to Chase the current technical demands of the industries from the employees and learner platforms. This paper also throws light on various challenges and opportunity and limitations observed during the implementation of DC-Model towards adaptability by every Technical Institution to satisfy future demands and improve the quality of education rather than quantity.
